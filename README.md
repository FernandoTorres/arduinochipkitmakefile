Arduino ChipKit Makefile
======================

Combination makefile for Aruino and ChipKit code.

I wrote a Makefile to automaticly compile and Arduino testes. I just realized this would be way helpful to update 
for my next set of projects.

So I'm copying that work here. Also, from the Arduino discussion list was pointed out that Arducopter has their 
own Arduino makefile. So I'm hoping to combine the best of both into this space.
